Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".

Boolean Values
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
print(10 > 9)  #true
print(10 == 9) #false
print(10 < 9) #false

Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
 we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5) 


List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets: mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
