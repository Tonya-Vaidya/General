Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".

Boolean Values
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
print(10 > 9)  #true
print(10 == 9) #false
print(10 < 9) #false

Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
 we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5) 


List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets: mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets. mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")


Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
 
Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
