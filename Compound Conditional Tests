and Operator: Both conditions must be true for the entire expression to be true.

## Example 

age = 25
city = "New York"

if age >= 18 and city == "New York":
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
## Expected outcome is eligible


## Example

is_raining = False
if not is_raining:
    print("Carry an umbrella")
else:
    print("Enjoy the weather")
## Expected outcome is "Enjoy the weather" because the bizarro backwards code of "if not"


## Example

temperature = 15
weather = "sleet"
if temperature < 5 or weather == "sleet":
    print("Take precautions")
else:
    print("Enjoy the weather")
## expected outcome of "Take precaution because one condition of sleet was met.
