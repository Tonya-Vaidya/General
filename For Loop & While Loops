## For Loop

for i in range(5): print(i)


  ## for i in range(5): This line initiates the loop.
  ##      [for i in:] This part declares a variable i that will take on values from the sequence generated by range().
  ##     [range(5):] This function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (not including 5). 
  ## print(i):
    This line is the code that will be executed repeatedly. In this case, it prints the current value of i to the console.


## Example

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
## Expected outcome 
## apple
## banana
## cherry

## Example

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
##Expected outcome
b
a
n
a
n
a

## Practice Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

##Expected outcome
apple
banana

##Cherry won't be printed because you put a break after banana. 



fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)
##Expected outcome
Apple

Because the break came BEFORE the PRINT code, it Won't print banana



## WHILE LOOPS Example



## Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
## Expected outcome
1
2
3
4
5

It won't print zero because you defined i as 1, and asked it to print starting at one, and adding 1 until it was less than 5

i = 1
while i < 9:
  print(i)
  i += 2

##Expected outcome will now add by 2 (starting at i which is 1) and ending before 9
1
3
5
7
